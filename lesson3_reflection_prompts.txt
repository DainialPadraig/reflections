When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Any time I know I want to keep the contents of my repo...or I want to access
    it from another computer or another location. I have become a total cloud
    convert over the past several years. It's so nice to be able to access my
    data and projects wherever I am in the world without worrying about a 
    hard drive crash or losing a thumb drive or trying to remember which
    computer has the latest version of a file on it. Keeping git repos on 
    GitHub means I don't have to worry about that.
    
    Of course, another great reason for using GitHub is that it makes it possible
    to collaborate on public and private projects with contributors all over the 
    world. Whether I'm working on my own open source projects or community projects
    for Code for Tucson or the Google Developers Group Tucson, it's great to be able
    to share our work in a single repo.
    
    It also doesn't hurt that GitHub is a great way to share projects you are
    proud of and would like to make part of your portfolio. I can't say I have
    a lot of those in my repos at present, but I'm working on it!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
